# This file is used to provide easy aliases to mimic a standard
# Symfony development environment. 
#
# Use : `source ./.tools/bash-alias` to get the aliases in your current
# session.
#
# Then enjoy `sf cache:clear`, `composer install` like before and stop
# worrying about Dockerish things

# Default PHP container name for the platform (previously www_caflyon)
