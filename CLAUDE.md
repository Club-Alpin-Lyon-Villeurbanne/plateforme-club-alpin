# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive management platform for French Alpine Clubs (Club Alpin Fran√ßais), built with Symfony 6.4 and PHP 8.3. The application manages events, members, content, and financial operations for multiple Alpine clubs across France.

## Development Environment

# - Mailcatcher: http://127.0.0.1:8025/

# Login credentials
# - Admin: test@clubalpinlyon.fr / test
# - Content Manager: admin_contenu / contenu
```

make tests path=tests/Unit/UserTest.php  # Run specific test
make tests clear=1         # Run tests with fresh database

make php-cs               # Check code style (dry-run)
make php-cs-fix           # Fix code style issues
make phpstan              # Run static analysis
```

**Database Operations:**
```bash
make database-init        # Full database setup (dev)
make database-init-test   # Setup test database
make database-migrate     # Run migrations
make database-migration   # Generate new migration
make database-fixtures-load  # Load fixture data
```

**Container Access:**
```bash
make exec                 # Access web container (default)
make exec container=cafdb cmd=bash  # Access database container
make logs                 # View all container logs
make logs services=cafdb  # View specific service logs
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Business Domains

1. **Event Management** (`Evt` entity)
   - Mountain outings and activities
   - Dual validation system (publication + legal approval)
   - Participant registration and management

2. **User Management** (`User` entity)
   - Member profiles with complex permission system
   - Commission-based access control
   - Parent/child account relationships

3. **Content Management** (`Article` entity)
   - News articles and announcements
   - Multi-stage approval workflow
   - Commission-specific content

4. **Expense Management** (Modern Vue.js module)
   - Located in `assets/vue/` directory
   - TypeScript + TailwindCSS implementation
   - Complex validation and approval rules

5. **Material Management**
   - Integration with external Loxya API
   - Equipment tracking and reservations

### Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Symfony 6.4 with PHP 8.3
- MySQL 8.0 database
- Doctrine ORM with extensive migrations
- Symfony Messenger for async processing

**Frontend:**
- Twig templates for traditional UI
- Vue.js 3 + TypeScript for expense reports
- TailwindCSS for modern components
- Vite for asset bundling

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker development environment (containers: www_pca, db_pca, phpmyadmin_pca, mail_pca)
- Clever Cloud hosting platform
- GitGuardian security monitoring

### Key Directories

- `src/` - Modern Symfony application code
- `legacy/` - Legacy PHP code and database schemas
- `assets/vue/` - Vue.js expense management module
- `templates/` - Twig templates
- `templates/content_html/` - Commission-specific page templates
- `config/` - Symfony configuration
- `tests/` - PHPUnit test suite
- `docs/` - Project documentation

### Database Structure

The application uses a hybrid approach combining:
- **Legacy tables** (prefixed with `caf_`) for core functionality
- **Modern Doctrine entities** for new features
- **Migration system** bridging old and new schemas

Key entities:
- `caf_user` - User management with flexible attributes
- `caf_evt` - Events with validation workflows
- `caf_commission` - Activity sections/departments
- `caf_article` - Content with approval system
- `expense_report` - Modern expense management

### External Integrations

- **FFCAM API** - French Alpine Federation member synchronization
- **Google Groups API** - Mailing list management
- **Loxya API** - Material/equipment management platform
- **Mailgun** - Email delivery service
- **Sentry** - Error monitoring
- **Google Drive** - Commission file storage

## Development Workflows

### Working with Tests
```bash
# Run specific test class
make tests path=tests/Unit/Service/UserServiceTest.php

# Run tests with coverage (if configured)
make tests args="--coverage-html coverage/"

# Run functional tests only
make tests path=tests/Functional/

# Reset test database before running
make tests clear=1
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Start asset watching for development
make npm-watch

# Build production assets
make npm-build

# Work with Vue.js expense module
cd assets/vue/
# Vue components are in assets/vue/components/
# TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration after entity changes
make database-migration

# Apply pending migrations
make database-migrate

# Generate migration based on entity differences
make database-diff
```

### Code Quality
Always run before committing:
```bash
make php-cs-fix    # Fix code style
make phpstan       # Check static analysis
make tests         # Ensure tests pass
```

## Important Notes

### Container Names
The Docker containers use "pca" prefix (plateforme-club-alpin):
- `www_pca` - Web server
- `db_pca` - MySQL database
- `phpmyadmin_pca` - Database admin interface
- `mail_pca` - Mail catcher

### Legacy Integration
- Legacy code in `/legacy/` directory is preserved for compatibility
- Some URLs and routes bridge legacy and modern code
- Database schemas are imported from `legacy/data/` SQL files

### Permission System
- Complex role-based access control via `UserRights` class
- Commission-based permissions for different activity sections
- Multiple user types with varying capabilities

### Multi-Club Support
This platform serves multiple Alpine clubs:
- Configuration overrides in Clever Cloud console
- Club-specific branding and settings
- Shared codebase with customizable features

### Email System
- Transactional emails via Mailgun in production
- Local development uses Mailcatcher (port 8025)
- Template system for various notification types

### Expense Report Module
Modern Vue.js application with:
- Vee-validate for form validation
- Zod schemas for type safety
- Axios for API communication
- TailwindCSS for styling
